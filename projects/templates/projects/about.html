                            I am Joise MP, a freelance Visual Product Designer and Developer based in Kochi, India. I created
                            this website as my portfolio and to be able to share some of my projects with anybody who
                            is interested in using them as inspiration or research material.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I like to resolve design problems, create smart user interface and imagine useful interaction,
                            developing rich web experiences & web applications.
                            When not working or futzing around with code, I study how to escape from University. Actually
                            for hire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am hoping this project also
                            takes me out of my comfort zone and provides new challenges. So lots of exciting things to look
                            out for! If you're interested in my
                            journey stay tuned, and if you'd like to get in touch feel free to drop me a message.
                        </p>
